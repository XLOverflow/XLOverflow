MS in Information Networking @ Carnegie Mellon University  
**Systems / Distributed / Database / LLM Infrastructure**

I build **high-performance backend systems** and **production-oriented LLM pipelines**, with a focus on
distributed systems, database internals, and scalable AI tooling.

---

## Technical Focus

- **Database Systems**  
  Buffer pool management, B+-tree indexing, query execution engines, concurrency control

- **Distributed Systems**  
  Consensus (Raft), distributed KV stores, fault tolerance, performance engineering

- **LLM Systems & Infra**  
  RAG pipelines, agent frameworks, inference optimization, evaluation & tooling

## Selected Projects

### 🧱 BusTub — Database Management System (CMU 15-445)
**C++ · Buffer Pool · Indexing · Query Execution**

- Implemented core DBMS components including buffer pool manager, page replacement, and disk I/O
- Built B+-tree indexes and iterator-based query execution (scan / join / aggregation)
- Designed latch-based concurrency control and transaction context management  
→ *Educational DBMS with production-grade design principles*

---

### 🌐 TinyKV — Distributed Key-Value Store
**Go · Raft · Distributed Systems**

- Implemented Raft consensus, leader election, and dynamic cluster membership
- Built log compaction and snapshotting, reducing log size by **70%+**
- Sustained **100K+ ops/sec** with **98% availability** under failure scenarios  
→ *End-to-end distributed storage system*

---

### 🤖 LLM-Based Gray-Box Firmware Emulation
**LangChain · RAG · Vision LLM · FAISS**

- Designed an agent-driven pipeline to parse MCU manuals via OCR & Vision LLMs
- Built a rule-grounded RAG stack achieving **87.4% rule-level correctness**
- Automated translation from natural-language specs to structured schemas  
→ *LLMs applied to real systems & security tooling*
